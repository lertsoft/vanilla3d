## Learning Three JS

This project was done so that I can understand and document everything that i come across as i learn ThreeJS. </br>
The project is done in vanilla Javascript to reduce complexity as i am starting to learn this. </br>

I have tried to do the same thing with Angular, and Vue but failed... Mostly because I was also learning Angular and Vue.</br>
Complexity now is out of the question and now i will start from 0 to hero.<br>
